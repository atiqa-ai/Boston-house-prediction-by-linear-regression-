## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Linear Regression** on the **Boston Housing dataset** to predict median house prices based on key features such as:
- Crime rate  
- Number of rooms per dwelling  
- Property tax rate  
- Pupil-teacher ratio  
- Accessibility to highways  

The goal is to **analyze relationships** between features and prices, and evaluate how well Linear Regression predicts housing values.

## 📊 Steps & Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   Import dataset, handle missing values, and prepare features.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Scatter plots  
   - Feature importance  

3. **Model Training**  
   Train a **Linear Regression** model using Scikit-Learn.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - R² Score  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Predicted vs Real values visualization

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python (3.8+)  
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy  
- 🎨 Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- 🤖 Scikit-learn  

---

## 🎯 Results
- The model achieved a good fit on test data.  
- Visualization of predicted vs real prices shows closeness to the ideal line.

## ✨ Future Work
- Try other regression models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest).  
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.  
- Deploy model with Flask/Streamlit.
